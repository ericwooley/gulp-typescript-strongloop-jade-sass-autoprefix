# Warning
I don't know if typescript gulp and browserify get along very well, This project setup works, technically, but not very well, I have given up trying to import modules.

# gulp-typescript-strongloop-jade-sass-autoprefix
Gulp boilerplate for typescript, strongloop, jade, sass, and autoprefix

## Installation
```bash
npm install
gulp dev
```
Your browser should launch to localhost:9000 and the strongloop explorer should
be available at http://0.0.0.0:3000/explorer

## Todo
1. Create a dist task, without sourcemaps and without launching the servers
2. Create Unit Tests architecture
